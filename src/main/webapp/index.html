            Having start code laying ready and prepared that was modified by 
            yourself (and your group) <br> makes it very easy to understand what's
            going on and getting started with a project. <br>
            I personally had a problem with deployment (on my server) that was 
            of great annoyance, <br> but ultimately it was entirely caused by a 
            wrongly written password and has been solved now so that it won't be 
            repeated in the future. <br>
            Once again practising setting up the pipeline, deploying on Surge 
            and making everything work was a good refresher too.
